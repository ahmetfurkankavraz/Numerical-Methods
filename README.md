# Numerical-Methods

This repository created by using the Assignments and Exams of Numerical Methods Course, ITU.

The python files in _calculators_ file are created with [@serrabozkurt](https://github.com/serrabozkurt) for calculating Monomial, Lagrange and Newton Basis Interpolations of the Polynomial Functions.

The covered topics in this course are as in the below:

- Error Analysis
- Number Representation
- Non-Linear Equations
- Linear Systems
- Least Square Problems
- Eigenvalue Problems
- SVD
- Polynomial Interpolation
- Numerical Differentiation
- Numerical Integration
